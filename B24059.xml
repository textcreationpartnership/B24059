            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>That now, and ever, still it will endure:</l>
               <l>No Man, or Angel, never can it know,</l>

                  <l>THE Lord of Glory had a <hi>Vine-yard</hi> fair,</l>
                  <l>Whereof he took a very tender care,</l>

                  <l>Because it should yield him the sweetest Wine;</l>
                  <l>I'th' midst of it he built a Tower high,</l>
                  <l>For to be seen by all that passed by.</l>

                  <l>And when the Lord at this expense had been,</l>
                  <l>He Let it out unto some Husband-men:</l>

                  <l>Some of his Servants they did sorely beat,</l>

               <l>WHen as the final <hi>Judgment-day</hi> is come,</l>
               <l>Then Sinners look out for your fatal doom;</l>
               <l>And when the Lord descendeth with a shout,</l>
               <l>Ye Saints, do you triumphantly look out</l>
               <l>To meet your gracious Lord, and glorious King,</l>
               <l>That you to him may Hallelujahs Sing;</l>
               <l>Also lift up your heads, and do not fear;</l>
               <l>For your Redemption is a drawing near:</l>
               <l>The Trumpet then shall sound, the Dead shall rise,</l>
               <l>The Saints with Joys, the Sinners with sad cryes,</l>
               <l>Weeping and wailing, loudly crying thus;</l>
               <l>Ye Rocks and Mountains fall and cover us:</l>
               <l>Those things they will be dreadful for to see;</l>
               <l>Also the glorious Sun shall darkned be.</l>
               <l>The Powers of the Heavens they shall shake,</l>
               <l>And all the Earth most grievously shall quake.</l>
               <l>The Heavens shall be rolled as a scroul:</l>
               <l>Likewise, the Stars unto the Earth shall fall;</l>
               <l>And then the World with Fire shall be burned,</l>
               <l>And all things therein will be overturned.</l>
               <l>And when the Judge shall sit upon his Seat,</l>
               <l>To Execute his Judgments all compleat,</l>
               <l>Then all the Nations gathered shall be,</l>
               <l>And every Eye this righteous Judge shall see:</l>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:206500:39"/>
               <l>But he will them again all separate,</l>
               <l>And then to cry, Lord, Lord, 'twill be too late.</l>
               <l>He will set all the Saints on his Right-hand,</l>
               <l>And at his Left the Reprobate shall stand:</l>
               <l>Immediately the Sentence will be given,</l>
               <l>That all the Saints shall enter into Heaven,</l>
               <l>And with Salvation they shall Crowned be,</l>
               <l>And Live with Christ to all Eternity.</l>
               <l>The Reprobates then they will trembling stand,</l>
               <l>Ready to be thrust from the Lord's Left-hand;</l>
               <l>For they shall all be Sentenced to Hell,</l>
               <l>With damned Spirits ever for to dwell,</l>
               <l>Where they shall evermore both weep and wail;</l>
               <l>But yet, alas, nothing will then prevail:</l>
               <l>They shall be sent away too with a Curse;</l>
               <l>There is no Sorrow ever can be worse.</l>
